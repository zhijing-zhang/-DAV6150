The initial goal of the project is to provide support on identifying the number of customers who want to buy products from the insurance companies. "

Before we start building models, we will do some basic exploratory data analysis(EDA) and data preparation work. We plan to use the histogram, Box plot, scatter plot, bar chart, pair plot, and other graphics for visual analysis. Through the EDA process, we can also apply our domain knowledge of feature selection to provide us at least five explanatory variables for building models.\n",

We will use the confusion matrix including accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and support to compare their performance. At last, we are also going to construct our ensemble models. For the ensembling model, our initial plan is to choose three out of four models to build one ensembling model than we can use all the models we built before to make another ensemble model.\n",
