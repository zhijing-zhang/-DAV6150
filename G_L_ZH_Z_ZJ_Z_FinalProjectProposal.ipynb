Facebook auto tag or cell phone facial unlock and even remotely open a bank account. A recent survey showed that 72% of hotel operators are expected to deploy facial recognition by 2025 to identify and interact with guests. In addition to some survey, By 2024, the global facial recognition market could generate $7 billion in revenue. As we can see, facial recognition will become a common and useful technology."
